Welcome to the Splash MVC framework common library
==================================================

WORK IN PROGRESS
================

Splash 7 will be the first release to support PSR-7. It is currently in development. Meanwhile, the latest stable release
 you should use is Splash 5.1.

What is Splash?
---------------

Splash is a MVC PHP framework. It is making a heavy use of annotations, and of [the Mouf dependency injection framework](http://www.mouf-php.com).
You might want to use Splash in order to seperate cleanly the controllers (that perform the actions required when you navigate your web application) and the view (that generates and displays the HTML that makes your web pages).

What is this common library thing?
----------------------------------

This package contains the common functions used by all libraries respecting the Splash syntax (annotations, etc...)
All libraries you said? Yes, all libraries. Indeed, there are many packages respecting the Splash syntax.

Of course, there is [Splash (a full-featured MVC framework)](http://mouf-php.com/packages/mouf/mvc.splash).
But there is also [Druplash (a module for Drupal that adds a Splash-compatible MVC framework)](http://mouf-php.com/packages/mouf/integration.drupal.druplash),.
and [Moufpress (a plugin for Wordpress that adds a Splash-compatible MVC framework)](http://mouf-php.com/packages/mouf/integration.wordpress.moufpress).
